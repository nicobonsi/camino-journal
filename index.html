  <h2>What is the Camino?</h2>
  <p>
    The Camino de Santiago, or the Way of St. James, is an ancient pilgrimage route that has been walked for over a thousand years. It leads to the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, Spain, where tradition holds that the remains of the apostle Saint James are buried.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the centuries, people from all walks of life have embarked on the Camino for spiritual, personal, or cultural reasons. Today, the Camino attracts pilgrims from all over the world seeking reflection, adventure, and connection.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many routes to Santiago, but the <strong>Portuguese Coastal Route</strong> is a particularly scenic option. Starting in Porto, it follows the Atlantic coast before joining inland paths through Galicia. The full route from Porto to Santiago is approximately <strong>270 to 280 kilometers</strong>, depending on the exact path taken. Pilgrims usually walk it over <strong>10 to 14 days</strong>, averaging <strong>20–30 kilometers per day</strong>.

  <h2>My Camino</h2>
  <p>
    I’ve been wanting to walk the Camino for a while now. Living in Lisbon and loving the ocean, walking the Portuguese way seemed the one to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    I wanted to do this journey alone and knew that I needed a window of 14 days to do this so finding the right time was not easy. The window of opportunity presented itself this Easter with no family travel plans and the possibility for me to go, so I took it.
  </p>
  <p>
    I had no specific time in mind and no expectations other than walk and enjoy the journey. I had a clear destination and a clear route to follow — that was it. Everyday wake up and walk. When hungry find some food. When tired take a rest. When my body says stop, it’s time to rest and find a place to put my head down. Being alone I was never worried about finding a bunk to rest the night. If travelling in a group logistics become more complex.
  </p>
  <p>
    In preparation, I looked at the weather forecast and saw rain every day. What to do? Postpone? To when? I thought waiting for ideal condition would push this to a never trip. So Sunday 13th April I purchased my bus ticket from Lisbon to Porto leaving on Monday 14th April at 8:30am.
  </p>

  <h2>Day 1: Porto Matosinhos to Aguçadoura (35.7 km)</h2>

<p>Lisbon, 7:30 — off I go. I hopped on the bus at 8:30 and a few hours later arrived in Porto. It was pouring rain. I headed toward Matosinhos and began walking.
    The rain didn’t stop, and strong ocean winds swept in from the sea. Massive waves crashed, ocean spray hit my face, and the streets were empty. I asked myself, "What on earth am I doing?". The excitement of day-one and the thrill of starting something new gave me energy. The road along the ocean was beautiful. From time to time the rain paused, only to return minutes later.
  </p>
  <p>I walked with a fast pace, pushing forward with my new hiking poles. I didn’t see a single other pilgrim. My knees — especially the left one — started to hurt, but I pushed through. I had a good raincoat, so my upper body and backpack stayed dry, but the rest of me was soaking wet.</p>
  <p>When I arrived in Aguçadoura, I passed an AL (Alojamento Local) with a phone number on the door. I called and was lucky — they had a room available. Inside, I met a family — a father and his two adult daughters — who had started their Camino in Porto two days earlier.</p>
  <p>I took a hot shower and headed to a nearby café for a bite. It was run by a French couple who had left France three years ago, disillusioned with the direction the country was going and the education their two young children were receiving. They were incredibly happy with their new life in Portugal. Back in my room, I had a good night's sleep.</p>

  <p>Very different scenery from yesterday, and definitely harder. The day swung between bursts of heavy rain and moments of sunshine. I walked inland, moving from village to village (and church to church), mostly along countryside dirt paths. Lots of ups and downs, and plenty of mud.</p>
  <p>For lunch I had a comforting bowl of caldo verde soup, a Cotoletta Milanese (made with pork), plus rice and salad. Simple and warm — just what I needed.</p>
  <p> I found a room in a nice convent that receives pilgrims. I’ll eat in their cantine and get an early night’s sleep 💤. I don’t even have an ounce of energy left for a beer — imagine that.</p>
  <p>It’s a great hike. Tomorrow I’m aiming for something between 25 and 30 km. I'm thinking close to forty today was a stretch. I’m seriously glad I brought hiking poles — they make a real difference.</p>
  <p>Still about 176 km to go. We’ll see how it goes. A lot will depend on the terrain and the weather.</p>

  <p>Holà Spain 🇪🇸! Crossed the border and settled into A Guarda after a long and eventful day. I took a wrong turn that added a few extra kilometers to the walk — not ideal!</p>
  <p>The day started in the rain, but the weather cleared up later in the morning. The terrain was mixed: part ocean path, part mountain trail.</p>
  <p>For the river crossing into Spain, the boat wasn’t running due to the tide and technical issues. As I stood there wondering what to do, I started chatting with some fishermen. One of them kindly offered to take me across in his small boat.</p>
  <p>Before crossing, he invited me into his home where he and some friends were sharing a hearty lunch — a mix of rice, red beans, and sausages. At that point, anything would have tasted amazing. 
</p>
  <p>Once in A Guarda, I couldn’t face another 5 km to the next village. Luckily, I found a welcoming pilgrim dormitory with a bunk bed for the night. Put myself in corner and slept like a baby.

<p>Today’s walk had a bit of everything: a lot of ups and downs, peaceful forest trails, and scenic stretches along the coast. A little welcome rain, a few rays of sun.</p>
<p>I’ve found a house where a man rents out some beds in his house. Just across the road there was a traiteur, and I managed to grab a portion of paella and a large helping of meatballs just before they closed — dinner sorted.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, it’s supposed to rain heavily all day. Apparently the worst days are coming.</p>

  <p>It rained all day long — only a few brief pauses. From the morning until about 12:30, I was walking through Vigo and some larger Spanish towns. Aside from the old town centers, they’re not much to look at.</p>
  <p>The terrain was mostly flat and the roads easy, so I made good progress. I popped in my headphones — a rarity on this trip — and let Tiësto, David Guetta, AC/DC and the like push me forward.</p>
  <p>The path then turned uphill and downhill through muddy countryside trails. I’m fine going up — not so much going down.</p>
 <p>Today’s hike ended in Arcade</p>
  <p>I had some trouble finding accommodation. Everything seemed to be full. I didn’t see many people out and suspect a lot of pilgrims took the day off. Thankfully, I finally found a small hotel with a room.</p>
  <p>The hotel doesn’t serve food, and there’s a restaurant just 150 meters away. I had no energy left to head out and get soaked again. I chatted with a really helpful receptionist, from Argentina, who had a friend bring me food (I think he felt sorry for me!). I really needed it. Don’t think I’ve ever been that happy about a food delivery.</p>

  <p>Today was wild: heavy rain, thunder, lightning, and even a short hailstorm. I found myself counting the seconds between flashes of lightning and claps of thunder, trying to figure out whether the storm was moving away. Thankfully, it was.</p>
  <p>Some roads were more like rivers, with streams running down them and water up to my ankles. In some places, the drainage system felt like it was working in reverse.</p>
  <p>I marched along and didn’t see anyone for the first three hours. Then I must have reached a convergence point, because suddenly there were loads of people. It felt packed for a couple of hours — cafés were crowded with pilgrims trying to warm up — but once I passed them, the path thinned out again.</p>
  <p> At one point one of my hiking poles snapped. I push so hard on them that an aluminium connector gave way. I’d gotten really used to them. I felt really down when that happened as it messed up with my stride and momentum. But a little while later, I passed through a village and stumbled upon a Chinese bazar that was open. The shopkeeper was from Shanghai and we started chatting in Chinese. She sold some poles! I bought one, and boom — back in rhythm! One never knows what is around the corner!</p>
  <p>Around 14:00, I stopped in a village café. Got two pizzas — one to eat, one to carry — plus a coffee and a much-needed stretch. I called a dorm about two hours ahead to make sure they had a bunk. They did.</p>
  <p>I walked the final stretch alone, not seeing a single person. Got to the dorm in O Pino and had a warm shower — what a relief. Grateful for the pizza and microwave. Time for an early night. Tomorrow is the last stretch!</p>

  <p> I woke up early around 6:00 and was out the door by 6:30. It was so dark for the first hour that I used my phone flashlight to see where I was going.</p>
  <p>I hoped to quickly find a place for a coffee and food but nothing — everything was closed and I didn’t see anything or anyone for the first 10 km.</p>
  <p>Then I arrived at Padron stop, about 25 km from Santiago, and suddenly there were people on the walk. I passed a coffee shop but the line was longer than at a Lisbon Starbucks, so I marched on.</p>
  <p>I only had chocolate bars and was feeling the fatigue — physical and psychological. Knowing the end was near, my body started to give in to pain and aches again. Poor nutrition didn’t help.</p>
  <p>Around noon I finally found a place and had an omelette tortilla sandwich, a Coke, and a coffee. That helped. I stretched a little and continued, knowing I still had another three hours to go.</p>
  <p>The first part after the stop was okay — the sun even came out, which was lovely. But nearing Santiago, we entered the outer suburbs: a typical Spanish urban sprawl. Still, I could see the tip of the cathedral from far away — a welcome motivator.</p>
<p> I finally arrived!, that's it. I am standing in front of the Cathedral, the conclusion of 7 days walking. I stand in silence, a little overwhelmed, looking at people around me who are feeling the same. Some people have been walking for way longer than me - some 800 km and others even 1500 km! For many this is an achievement over several years where they do a section a year.</p>
<p> I go in the Cathedral, put in some good thoughts, and sit in peace and silence for a while. Now that I’ve done what I came to do in Santiago, soaked in the good energy, I had to think how to get back home. 
<p>
My options were to stay overnight and catch a day bus tomorrow (arriving late), or catch a night bus today and wake up at home with welcoming faces and a warm coffee. Easy choice. I took the 5:30pm bus and I’ll be home around 01:00. </p>

  <h2>What I took with me</h2>
  <p>I took the essentials to minimise weight and volume knowing that I could always buy along the way if needed</p>
  <p>
    I used my loyal small backpack that has followed me in many aventures around the world. It is light, robust, with good zippers, has many compartments and has always served me well. I packed 4 T-shirts, 4 underwear, 4 socks, a pair of shorts, flip flops, a sun hat, sun cream, swimming suit, quick dry towel, tooth paste, tooth brush, razor blade and foam, my sleeping sheet, survival blanket (aluminium cover), string and pegs, plastic bag, eye mask and ear plugs. Several ziplock bags to put things in and protect from water and dirt.   
  </p>
  <p>
    Below are pictures or what I packed. I should have had a better hoodie as the one I had got wet and never dried. My trousers were quick-dry but not waterproof so they were basically always soaked. Same with my shoes. Not sure what other options would be available. I did not get any blisters with my shoes so that was a plus. At night I was often cold so having a set of night clothes and a sleeping bonnet would have been nice. I took a book and that was not necessary as too tired to read. For the first time I used hiking poles and they were essential!
  </p>
<p>
    Overall my priority goes to equipment that is easy to use, lights, quick to dry, with loads of pockets and easy to put on and off when on the move. I saw many people with way too much stuff, needing help to put on their raincoat for example. That is not efficient and more importantly breaks the stride and pace you have when going. Any time I stopped I could feel my muscles got tense and needed some time to get going again.

  <h2>What I spent</h2>
  <p>This is a breakdown of what I spent this week: </p>
  <p><strong>Transport to and from Lisbon by bus</strong>: 17.48+79.47 (last bus ticket available)=96.95 </p>
  <p><strong>Food:</strong> (17)+(4.10+10.2)+(14+11.20)+(25.9+14.70)+(1.75+12)+(6+17.80)+(6+12+4.9)=157.55 </p>
  <p><strong>Accommodation:</strong> 20+15+10+16+55+10=126</p>
  <p><strong>Equipment before leaving:</strong> 38 (poles but I will get a refund for them) + 50 (bits and pieces from decathlon - T-shirts, shocks) = 50 (I don't count the poles) </p> 
  <p><strong>Extras:</strong> Hiking Pole replacement = 9.99 </p>
  <p><strong>TOTAL: 96.95+157.55+126+50+9.99=EUR440.49</strong></p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    The walk was a great experience and I would not change anything about it, even the weather. What started out in my mind as a long relaxing hike turned into quite the opposite. The walking pace I took, the daily distance and the terrible weather turned it into a physical and mental challenge. I now feel stronger, fitter and ready to tackle what comes my way. Mentally, I feel like a better person for me and the people around me. I guess that is why people do these things. 
</p>

  <p>
Some random thoughts about the hike and life that crossed my mind in no particular order, just reflections from the road (loads of time to think):
  </p>

  <p>
   <strong>Good Thing. Bad Thing. Who knows.</strong>
You never knows what is round the corner.
</p>

  <p>
   <strong>It’s mostly about the journey.</strong>
The destination matters. But the magic is in the steps along the way.
</p>

<p>
<strong>When it gets tough, lock in.</strong>
Put one foot in front of the other. Keep going. You’ll get through it. You always do.
</p>

<p>
<strong>If you can’t control it, don’t complain about it.</strong>
Save your energy for what you can change.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Everything is about consistent, well placed effort and time.</strong>
Every day I had to walk for about 8 hours at 5km/h, whatever the situation, no excuses. That’s it. If I did that, I’d arrive and be ahead of 99% of the people.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Storms pass.</strong>
After the worst storms, the blue sky returns. And after sunshine, rain will come. Expect both. Embrace both.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Simplicity clears the soul.</strong>
Less clutter—physically, mentally, emotionally—is freeing. There’s something deeply calming about carrying just what you need and nothing more.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Mind over body.</strong>
When I felt low and physically drained, my mind carried me. Even when I thought I had nothing left, there was still a bit more in the tank. Day 2 and the final day were the hardest. Day 1 was fueled by excitement. But Day 2 the aches kicked in. From Day 3 to 6, my body adapted and got stronger. Then on the last day, my mind started to relax too early. Even though there were still many hours left to walk. The second I finished, my body shut down. It’s all mental.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Perspective is powerful.</strong>
Be careful what voices you let in. On Day 6, I pushed an extra hour so my final day would “only” be 35km. But that night in the dorm, everyone was splitting their final 35km over two days. Suddenly, what felt short started to feel long. That shift in context played tricks on me. Be careful who you surround yourself with. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Fuel matters.</strong>
At a brisk pace, you burn about 800-1000 kcal per 10km. That’s about 5000-6000 kcal needed for a 40km day (2000 kcal base). You feel it if you don’t eat right. I had days with solid meals and others where I just got by. The difference in energy, mood, and recovery is massive. Same goes for water. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Rest is sacred.</strong>
A solid night of sleep will relieve many aches. Have good ear plugs, eye mask, and something comfortable to sleep in. Sleep well, move well, and push again.
</p>

  THE END<br>
  Until the next adventure!
